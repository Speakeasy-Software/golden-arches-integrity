## 🏷️ Label System (43 Labels)

### By Category:
- **Priority**: 4 labels (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Components**: 7 labels (frontend, backend, ml-pipeline, rule-engine, azure, database, docs)
- **Types**: 6 labels (bug, feature, improvement, refactor, security, performance)
- **ML/AI**: 5 labels (experiment, model-training, data-prep, deployment, monitoring)
- **Brand Rules**: 5 labels (gold-color, geometry, heritage, token, background)
- **Status**: 6 labels (needs-triage, in-progress, blocked, ready-for-review, testing, deployed)
- **Azure**: 4 labels (ml-workspace, blob-storage, compute, deployment)
- **General**: 6 labels (good-first-issue, help-wanted, question, duplicate, wontfix, cursor-ai)

## 🎯 Project Milestones (5 Phases)

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** (Feb 2024)
   - Azure infrastructure, backend API, testing

2. **Phase 2: Data Collection & UI** (Mar 2024)
   - React frontend, annotation system, asset management

3. **Phase 3: Rule Engine Development** (Apr 2024)
   - All 14 McDonald's brand rules implementation

4. **Phase 4: ML Model Training** (May 2024)
   - Dataset prep, model training, validation

5. **Phase 5: Production Deployment** (Jun 2024)
   - Production deployment, monitoring, CI/CD

## 📊 Parsed Issues (9 Issues)

From your `golden-arches-github-issues.md`, I've parsed and converted:

1. **Image Collection Web UI with Cursor AI** (medium priority)
2. **Rule Awareness: Encode Brand Integrity Rules** (high priority)
3. **Image Preprocessing Pipeline** (medium priority)
4. **Identify Heritage Brand Marks** (low priority)
5. **Dataset Versioning + Labeling** (medium priority)
6. **Evaluate Environment Context in Image** (medium priority)
7. **Compliance Scoring Engine** (high priority)
8. **Deploy Model on Azure for Inference** (high priority)
9. **Reporting Dashboard** (low priority)

## 🚀 Quick Setup Commands

### 1. Set Up GitHub Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/golden-arches-integrity

# Set up all labels and milestones
./scripts/github_issues/setup_github.sh

# Create all issues from your markdown
./scripts/github_issues/create_issues.sh
```

### 2. Verify Setup
```bash
# Check labels
gh label list

# Check milestones
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones

# Check issues
gh issue list
```

## 🎯 McDonald's Brand Rules Integration

The system is specifically designed for McDonald's brand compliance with:

### Dedicated Labels for Each Rule:
- `brand:gold-color` - RGB(255,188,13) compliance
- `brand:geometry` - Rotation, flipping, warping detection
- `brand:heritage` - Heritage mark handling
- `brand:token` - Token asset compliance
- `brand:background` - Background legibility

### Rule-Specific Issue Tracking:
- Each of the 14 brand rules has dedicated tracking
- ML experiments can target specific rules
- Compliance metrics per rule
- Edge case documentation

## 📈 Advanced Features

### ML Experiment Tracking
- Dedicated issue template for ML experiments
- Integration with Azure ML workspace
- Hypothesis and results documentation
- Model performance tracking

### Automated Workflows
- Auto-labeling based on file paths
- Status transitions with PR merges
- Milestone progress tracking
- Weekly reporting automation

### Brand Compliance Focus
- McDonald's-specific terminology
- Asset type categorization (Photography, Render, Heritage, Token)
- Compliance status tracking
- Rule violation severity levels

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Development Process:
1. **Issue Creation** → Use templates, add labels, assign milestone
2. **Triage** → Weekly review, prioritize, assign team members
3. **Development** → Status updates, branch creation, code review
4. **Testing** → Validation, compliance checking
5. **Deployment** → Production release, monitoring

### ML Experiment Process:
1. **Hypothesis** → Create ML experiment issue
2. **Setup** → Configure Azure ML experiment
3. **Execution** → Run training, log metrics
4. **Analysis** → Document results, insights
5. **Integration** → Deploy successful models

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Review the setup** - Check all generated files
2. **Run setup scripts** - Execute GitHub CLI commands
3. **Test templates** - Create a sample issue
4. **Customize labels** - Adjust colors/descriptions if needed
5. **Train team** - Share the tracking guide

### Integration Options:
1. **Azure DevOps** - Link issues to Azure ML experiments
2. **Slack/Teams** - Set up notifications for issue updates
3. **Jira** - Sync with existing project management tools
4. **Analytics** - Set up dashboards for issue metrics
