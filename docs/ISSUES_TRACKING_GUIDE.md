2. Create feature branch
3. Implement solution
4. Update to `status:ready-for-review`
5. Code review process
6. Move to `status:testing`
7. Deploy and mark `status:deployed`

### 4. ML Experiment Workflow
1. Create ML experiment issue
2. Set up Azure ML experiment
3. Document hypothesis and approach
4. Run experiments and log results
5. Update issue with findings
6. Close with summary and next steps

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Integration

### GitHub CLI Setup
Run the setup script to configure your repository:
```bash
# Set up labels and milestones
./scripts/github_issues/setup_github.sh

# Create issues from markdown
./scripts/github_issues/create_issues.sh
```

### Azure DevOps Integration
- Link GitHub issues to Azure ML experiments
- Track model performance metrics
- Monitor deployment status

### Automation
- Auto-label issues based on file paths
- Auto-assign based on component expertise
- Auto-close issues when PRs are merged

## üìà Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics to Track
- Issues opened/closed per week
- Time to resolution by priority
- Component-specific issue trends
- ML experiment success rates
- Brand rule compliance coverage

### Weekly Reports
