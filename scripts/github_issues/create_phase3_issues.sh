**Individual Model Excellence Priority:**
- **No Accuracy Sacrifice**: Will not accept decreases in top-performing rules
- **Innovation Required**: Creative solutions for complex rules without quality compromise
- **Individual Focus**: Perfect individual models before unification
- **Future Extensibility**: Build toward unified model capability

**Shared Feature Optimization:**
- **Natural Overlaps**: Identify and leverage as system develops
- **High-Performing Rules**: Start with most obvious rules (like color)
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Enable cross-rule learning capabilities
- **Logical Groupings**: Identify rule groupings as patterns emerge

**Analysis Activities:**
- Analyze feature importance across rules
- Identify shared visual patterns
- Optimize model architectures for efficiency
- Implement transfer learning between rules

**Success Criteria:**
- Maintain 90%+ accuracy across all individual rules
- Identify optimization opportunities without quality loss
- Document shared features and overlaps" \

--body "### Single Model Architecture Development

**Unified Architecture:**
- **Structure**: Single model with 14 output heads per rule
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant rules per asset type
- **Asset Type Awareness**: Different rule applications for PDF vs image
- **Logo vs Token Detection**: Automatic detection and rule adjustment

**Multi-Task Learning:**
- Design multi-task learning architecture
- Implement attention mechanisms for rule-specific features
- Balance rule-specific vs shared representations
- Optimize for accuracy consistency across all rules

**Context Integration:**
- **Asset Type Context**: PDF vs image different rule focus
- **Usage Context**: Digital vs print vs storefront applications
- **Partner Context**: Special rules for partner usage scenarios
- **Heritage Context**: Framework for heritage-specific processing

**Success Criteria:**
- Single model maintains 90%+ accuracy across all 14 rules
- Efficient inference with appropriate rule selection
- Seamless logo vs token detection and processing" \

gh issue create --title "Phase 3.3: Performance Harmonization" \
--body "### Consistent Performance Across All Rules

**Performance Consistency:**
- **Target**: Ensure consistent 90%+ accuracy across all rules
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify and address performance gaps
- **Rule-Specific Tuning**: Implement fine-tuning for underperforming rules
- **Dataset Balancing**: Balance dataset sizes and training emphasis

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Validation Consistency**: Validate performance consistency across rules
- **Expert Review**: Continuous expert validation of model decisions
- **A/B Testing**: Compare individual vs unified model performance
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure improvements don't degrade other rules

**Optimization Activities:**
- Performance gap identification and remediation
- Rule-specific fine-tuning implementation
- Dataset size and quality balancing
- Cross-rule performance validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All 14 rules consistently performing at 90%+ accuracy
- No rule performance degradation during optimization
- Expert validation confirms consistent quality" \
